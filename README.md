This application leverages Next.js, a robust React framework, to build server-side rendered and statically generated web applications.

We have integrated Clerk for seamless user authentication, providing a secure and user-friendly login experience.

Our backend is powered by Railway MongoDB, a NoSQL database, and we use Mongoose for elegant MongoDB object modeling in Node.js.
This project is designed as a full-featured real estate application.
